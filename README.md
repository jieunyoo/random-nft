# Random NFT

This project mines a random NFT on the Rinkeby test net. Users should connect their wallet, and then can mine a NFT.

The project is live at [random NFT](https://name-jieun-random-nft.jieun123.repl.co/). Note the link is using free hosting, so it most probably lag on startup.

Some sample NFTs created are [here](https://testnets.opensea.io/tetras).
The frontend code is under development, and can be browsed [here](https://replit.com/@jieun123/).
